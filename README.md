# EventTrackerProject

### Description
This homework was similar to our prior assignments using CRUD operations, just no front end. This weekend, we create an application similar, but using REST API.  

UPDATED:
We added a front end to our web app, using Angular.

### Lessons Learned
Better understanding of using RESTful services, repositories and Postman. Interested to see how frontend will talk to these technologies.

UPDATED:
A better understanding of Typescript functions and how it talks to the back end.

### Technologies Used
Java, REST, JPA, Postman

UPDATED:
Javascript, Angular, Typescript, HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP


### What was fun?

Creating your own database has always been fun to me, and making those come to life using Java is still like magic. Learning to implement a frontend will be interesting to see next week.

UPDATED:
Angular is not fun.
